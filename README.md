# üëã Hello there fellow ü¶Ñ 

### üë©üèΩ‚Äçüíª Frontend Developer üìö üíª
You might be wondering who I am ?

Hey there! First and foremost, I'm a supermom of two who decided to dive into the frontend development world during the craziest times. Juggling a developer bootcamp while dealing with baby giggles and toddler escapades wasn't a walk in the park. But hey, if I can code with a toddler on one knee and a baby on the other, imagine what I can do in front of a dual monitor setup!

So, a bit about me:
Confidence? Check. I'll voice my opinions, even if I'm the only one in the room with them.
Meeting new people? No problem. If you're interesting, expect a conversation!
Negotiation? Oh, I'm the one who'll try to haggle at fixed-price stores.
Efficiency over mere order? Always. It's not just about tidying up; it's about optimizing.
Control-freak? Only when things go south. I always believe there's a solution.
Goal-setting? Every day. How else do you think I manage kids and code?
Time Management? So good, I sometimes forget to lunch (but I‚Äôm working on that!).

A time back, I was listening to Brian Tracy on a podcast and he asked a pivotal question that I never would have said yes to in my past life.
And it was: **If you were financially independent, would you still be working in your current profession?**

My immediate answer was: YES!
