# üëã Hello there fellow ü¶Ñ 

### üë©üèΩ‚Äçüíª Frontend Developer üìö üíª
You might be wondering who I am ?

Let me tell you that, foremost, I‚Äôm a mother of two. Moreover, I‚Äôm a passionate frontend developer.
I graduated from a developer bootcamp in the peeking season of Corona back in 2020. I was breastfeeding my six month old baby AND had my two-year-old running around at the same time as my developer bootcamp in the world‚Äôs strictest quarantine .
It wasn‚Äôt easy, but I was devoted that I was going to finish my education and become a developer.
I did finish the boot camp, and I do work as a frontend developer.

But I want you to stop for a minute and ask yourself, Can you imagine changing your career completely? Imagine yourself spending nights and days learning something completely different after two years of sleep deprivation?
If you can, please continue.

A time back, I was listening to Brian Tracy on a podcast and he asked a pivotal question that I never would have said yes to in my past life.
And it was: **If you were financially independent, would you still be working in your current profession?**

My immediate answer was: YES!
